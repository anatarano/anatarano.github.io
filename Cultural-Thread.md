> Food is such an integral part of one's culture.
****And when we encounter a new climate – especially during climate chaos, where we're shifting, we’re moving seasons, the weather patterns are changing – we should reach back to our indigenous, traditional, ecological knowledge, and approach our farming practices from that lens.

> Food is for all people. It's a human right. And for me, food sovereignty really means that a community gets to make their own choices.

> With farming, I found that missing link I was always seeking — connection to the ***‘āina*** [love of the land]*,* the greatest teacher, with my hands and with my heart. 
My mission is to emulate the ***mahi‘ai*** [traditional Hawaiian farmers] who came before me. *Mahi‘ai* did more than just cultivate food. They were masters of observation, forming a deep relationship with the land — from the soil and plants to the weather patterns and moon cycles. This intimate connection not only affected the way they grew food, but also how they made sense of the world around them.
